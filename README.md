                                                       !!!LOOK AT HERE!!!
                                                  When you download the file
                                                  open it with Visual Studio Code
                                                  Then create a new terminal.
                                                  On terminal, type:
                                                  npm install discord.js
                                                  npm i dotenv 
                                                
                                                  Create a file called .env then
                                                  Add token and dbToken like this

                                                  token=your_bots_token_goes_here
